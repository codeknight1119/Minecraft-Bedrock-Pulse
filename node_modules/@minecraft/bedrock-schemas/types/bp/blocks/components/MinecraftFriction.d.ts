/**
 * Friction (minecraft:friction)
 * Describes the friction for this block in a range of 0.0 to 0.9.
 * Friction affects an entity's movement speed when it travels on
 * the block. Higher values result in more friction (less sliding). The
 * default value is 0.4, which is used by most blocks. Ice uses 0.02
 * for its slippery surface.
 * NOTE: Alternate Simple Representations

 * This can also be represent as a simple `Decimal number`.
